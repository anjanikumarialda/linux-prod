# Meeting Time Tracker v2 - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
Meeting Time Tracker v2 is a modern web application built to help teams track and manage their meeting times efficiently. The application is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and integrates with various Azure services.

## Important Note on Data Handling
This application follows a zero-storage architecture for enhanced privacy and security:

### No Data Storage Policy
- **No Persistent Storage**: The application does not store any meeting data, conversations, or user information
- **Real-Time Processing Only**: All data is processed in real-time and not saved
- **Privacy First**: Meeting contents remain private and are only processed during the active session
- **Temporary Processing**: AI features process data in-memory only, with no persistence
- **Microsoft Graph Integration**: Relies on Microsoft 365's existing data for calendar and user information

### Data Flow Clarification
1. **Meeting Information**
   - Data exists only during active sessions
   - No historical meeting data is stored
   - All processing happens in real-time

2. **User Data**
   - Authentication handled through Azure AD
   - User profiles accessed directly from Microsoft 365
   - No additional user data stored locally

3. **AI Processing**
   - Real-time processing only
   - No storage of processed results
   - Immediate response generation

4. **Analytics**
   - Real-time calculations only
   - No historical data maintained
   - Reports generated on-demand without storage

## Environment Configuration
The project uses the following environment variables:

### Azure AD Configuration
```env
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID="..."
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID="..."
AZURE_AD_APP_CLIENT_ID="..."
AZURE_AD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
AZURE_AD_APP_TENANT_ID="..."
```

### NextAuth Configuration
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="..."
```

### Azure OpenAI Configuration
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="..."
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="..."
```

## Authentication Setup
1. Azure AD integration for secure user authentication
2. Both delegation and application permissions configured
3. NextAuth.js implementation for session management
